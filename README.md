# PIXel-Toolbox
Routines to create pixel lists for stack collections. See the pixelToolboxManual.pdf for more info.

This version of the PIXel-Toolbox is not complete. It has the ability to create pixel lists and the standard structures
for pixel collections so that it can be used with the UAV-Toolbox. It needs modification for the pixel retrieval backend.
